These are components that we open source to encourage experimentation but these are components that are not officially supported .

Components \u00b6 The following components are implemented. Meta \u00b6 rasa_nlu_examples.meta.Printer \u00b6 This component will print what each featurizer adds to the NLU message. Very useful for debugging Dense Featurizers \u00b6 rasa_nlu_examples.featurizers.dense.FastTextFeaturizer \u00b6 These are the pretrained embeddings from FastText, see for more info here . These are available in 157 languages, see here . rasa_nlu_examples.featurizers.dense.BytePairFeaturizer \u00b6 These BytePair embeddings are specialized subword embeddings that are built to be lightweight. See this link for more information. These are available in 227 languages and you can specify the subword vocabulary size as well as the dimensionality.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#components","text":"The following components are implemented.","title":"Components"},{"location":"#meta","text":"","title":"Meta"},{"location":"#rasa_nlu_examplesmetaprinter","text":"This component will print what each featurizer adds to the NLU message.
